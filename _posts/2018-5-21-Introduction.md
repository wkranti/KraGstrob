This blog focus on working with forced alignment.This is part of GSoC 2018 project.
The organization is Red Hen Lab . This blog would also incorporate extended language
support to Gentle Aligner.Robert Ochshorn is main developer . I would be collaborating
with him in this project . The Gentle Aligner is already well know for its alignment in
English,now this would also be included in other language such as Spanish,Chinese,
Russian,German. This blog aims on how we can do forced alignment in Non-English languages.
It can also be considered as tutorials or roadmap to do so.
